			<h3 class="question">Q: Who are we?</h3>
			<p class="answer"><b class="answer-start">A:</b> We are a team of UC Berkeley students who have been closely following the developments surrounding COVID-19. Specifically, weâ€™ve been following all of the engineers, makers, and medical professionals who are coming together to generate creative solutions and designs to tackle the dearth of PPE and medical parts in hospitals.</p>

			<h3 class="question">Q: What are we doing?</h3>
			<p class="answer"><b class="answer-start">A:</b> In the immediate future, our goal for this project is to create a network for the production & distribution of medical parts (such as ventilators, masks, gloves) by connecting medical institutions with medical equipment suppliers other than manufacturing giants; such as those who have a surplus of medical supplies or with those who can design/create parts. </p>
			<p class="answer">In the longer term, we hope to create and mobilize a community of makers, manufacturers, and designers to help reduce the increasingly large gaps within the medical supply chain in the United States. Currently, many Americans feel trapped at home helpless watching as household after household falls to the tragedy of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope to revitalize that current despair and restlessness into the resolve and grit of the American people that has pulled America through every crisis. As our grandparents collected cans for bullets and rolled bandages for first aid kits in WW2, we hope that we will see individual Americans and small businesses mobilize to open source the designs for vital medical equipment, sew surgical masks, construct gowns, build face shields, and 3D print much-needed materials for the battle we now face against COVID-19. </p>

			<h3 class="question">Q: How can you help?</h3>
			<p class="answer"><b class="answer-start">A:</b> If you're a <b>doctor, nurse, or another medical professional,</b> then first just let us say thank you from the bottom of our hearts for fearlessly putting your lives on the line every day to combat the spread of this virus. If your hospital/institution is running low on supplies of any kind please list your need, location and contact information on our platform and we will do our very best to match you with people who have the supplies you need or can make them if need be.</p>
			<p class="answer">If you're a <b>maker, designer, or inventor</b> in possession of 3D printing or any other relevant manufacturing equipment, please list the equipment and materials you currently possess, your skills and background, the parts you believe you're capable of producing, and your ability to ship on the platform. We will do our best to match you in order of the greatest need and closest location.</p>
			<p class="answer">If you're <b>looking to help but don't know how,</b> please browse through the guides our team and community are working to put together about how to assemble various PPE from easily accessible supplies. If you think you have the ability to follow these guides and construct these vital resources then list your availability on our platform as well as your location and capacity (by quantity) and ability to ship on the platform. We will do our best to match you in order of the greatest need and nearest location. </p>
